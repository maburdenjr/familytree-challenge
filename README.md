# Family Tree Visualization Coding Challenge 

Implement at least 2 of the followings:

* Take a name as input and output the grand parent's name. e.g. Kevin => Nancy
* Print the names of people with no siblings. e.g. Nancy, Kevin, Mary
* Print the names of people with no children. e.g. Adam, Samuel, Patrick, Robert etc...
* Print the name of the person with largest number of grand children. e.g. Jill
* Draw the family tree

## Some Instructions

Double-click on any member of the family tree to add a direct descendant. Dynamic descendants will have a yellow background with a broken border. Descendant names are editable, but the names in the original family tree are not.
Press the esc key after you click on any family member to delete that member and his/her descendants.
